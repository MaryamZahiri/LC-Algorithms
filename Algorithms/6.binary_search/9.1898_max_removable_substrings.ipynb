    "## 1898. [Maximum Number of Removable Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-removable-characters/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two strings s and p where p is a subsequence of s. You are also given a distinct 0-indexed integer array removable containing a subset of indices of s (s is also 0-indexed).\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to choose an integer k (0 <= k <= removable.length) such that, after removing k characters from s using the first k indices in removable, p is still a subsequence of s. More formally, you will mark the character at s[removable[i]] for each 0 <= i < k, then remove all marked characters and check if p is still a subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum k you can choose such that p is still a subsequence of s after the removals.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"abcacb\", p = \"ab\", removable = [3,1,0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: After removing the characters at indices 3 and 1, \"abcacb\" becomes \"accb\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\"ab\" is a subsequence of \"accb\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If we remove the characters at indices 3, 1, and 0, \"abcacb\" becomes \"ccb\", and \"ab\" is no longer a subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the maximum k is 2."
