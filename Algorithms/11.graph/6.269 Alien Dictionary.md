# LeetCode Problem 269: [Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/)
## Problem Description
There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the order of the letters is unknown to you.

You are given a list of strings words from the alien language's dictionary. Now it is claimed that the strings in words are 
sorted lexicographically
 by the rules of this new language.

If this claim is incorrect, and the given arrangement of string in words cannot correspond to any order of letters, return "".

Otherwise, return a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in lexicographically increasing order by the new language's rules. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

> sorted lexicographically: A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alien language than the corresponding letter in b. If the first min(a.length, b.length) characters do not differ, then the shorter string is the lexicographically smaller one.

## Solution Approaches
Topological sorting is used in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It orders the vertices linearly such that for every directed edge from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering. Here's how it works:

- Identify vertices with no incoming edges: These are your starting points.
- Remove these vertices: Take them out of the graph, and also remove their outgoing edges.
- Repeat: Look for new vertices with no incoming edges, remove them and their edges.
- Continue until the graph is empty: The order in which you removed the vertices is your topological sort.

This method ensures that each node appears before all the nodes it points to, respecting the directionality of edges. It's useful in scenarios like task scheduling, where some tasks must precede others.

### BFS Algorithm
### DFS Algorithm
Algorithm Pattern:
- A topological Sort
- DFS -> Recursive
- Post order DFS: if there is no child for vertix, add it to visited and backtrack to previous node by popping the visited node at the end
- Reverse the order

1. Initialization:
    - Create Adjacency list/Graph
        - if length of word 1 is larger than length of word 2, but they have the first min(length) letters are the same, there is invalid solution -> ""
        - differ at the first letter, add to adjecency list and break
    - Track Visited (False:visited, True:current path)
    - Store the ordered dictionary
2. DFS Function
    - Check if node is visited
    - Track node in the current path. mark node in current path as True

    - Check neighbors for any cycle
    - If there is no cycle, marcked the visited node as False
    - Add the node to result in order

3. Run Main
    - Loop to adjacency and check for any cycle
    - Reverse the order
    - Return list of ordered characters as string
## Example Description BFS
```python
words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
```
Step 1: Build the Graph
We need to represent character order constraints as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Process:
Compare adjacent words to determine relationships between characters:

Compare "wrt" and "wrf" → t -> f (from the first differing characters).
Compare "wrf" and "er" → w -> e.
Compare "er" and "ett" → r -> t.
Compare "ett" and "rftt" → e -> r.
Construct the adjacency list and in-degree dictionary:
```python
Adjacency List (Edges):
t -> f
w -> e
r -> t
e -> r

In-degree (Incoming Edges):
w: 0
e: 1
r: 1
t: 1
f: 1

Graph Representation:
    w → e → r → t → f

```
Step 2: Perform Topological Sort
We now perform topological sorting to determine the order of characters.

Algorithm:
Start with nodes having in-degree = 0:

Initial queue = [w] (only w has no incoming edges).
Process the queue:

Remove w from the queue:

Add w to the order: order = [w].
Reduce in-degree of e: e.in-degree = 0.
Add e to the queue: queue = [e].
Remove e from the queue:

Add e to the order: order = [w, e].
Reduce in-degree of r: r.in-degree = 0.
Add r to the queue: queue = [r].
Remove r from the queue:

Add r to the order: order = [w, e, r].
Reduce in-degree of t: t.in-degree = 0.
Add t to the queue: queue = [t].
Remove t from the queue:

Add t to the order: order = [w, e, r, t].
Reduce in-degree of f: f.in-degree = 0.
Add f to the queue: queue = [f].
Remove f from the queue:

Add f to the order: order = [w, e, r, t, f].
Check for a Cycle:

If the size of order matches the number of unique characters, there’s no cycle.
Otherwise, the input is invalid (a cycle exists).

Step 3: Output the Result
The topological order is:

```python
order = "wertf"

```

Visualizing Topological Sorting
```python
Step-by-Step Resolution:
1. Start with node 'w':
    w → e → r → t → f

2. Visit 'e' next:
       e → r → t → f

3. Visit 'r' next:
          r → t → f

4. Visit 't' next:
             t → f

5. Visit 'f' last:
                f

```
Takeaway Key:
- Topological Sort processes nodes in the correct dependency order.
- The queue-based algorithm ensures nodes with no remaining dependencies are processed first.
- The final order is constructed by appending nodes to the order list as they are processed.

    def alienOrder(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        # Topological sort
        
        # Init graph
        # all neighbors to each vertices

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity : O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (characters) and E is the number of edges (prefix relationships).
    - Why we don't consider the graph creation time as the primary factor in the time complexity analysis is that the DFS, which follows the graph creation?

    - The graph creation step has a time complexity of O(N^2 * M), where N is the number of words and M is the average length of the words. This step involves iterating through all pairs of words to check for prefix relationships, which can be computationally expensive.

    - However, when analyzing the overall time complexity, we often ```focus on the most significant operations``` that dominate the running time. In this case, the Depth-First Search (DFS) used to detect cycles in the graph is the most time-consuming operation. The DFS has a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (characters) and E is the number of edges (prefix relationships). This complexity is dominated by the number of vertices and edges in the graph, which can be much larger than the number of words and their average length.

    - The reason we don't consider the graph creation time as the primary factor in the time complexity analysis is that the DFS, which follows the graph creation, is the operation that scales with the size of the graph (V and E) and is more directly related to the problem's constraints (the number of characters and their relationships). The graph creation step is a setup phase that prepares the data for the DFS, and its time complexity is a part of the overall complexity but is not the most significant factor when considering the Big O notation.

- Space complexity : O(N * M), where N is the number of words and M is the average length of the words. In the worst case, every character in every word needs to be visited, resulting in a space complexity of O(N * M). 

## Questions
- What is Topological Sort -> 
    - Should be DAG ```(Directed Acyclic Graph)``` -> Directed graph but no cycle
    - A ```linear ordering``` of vertices such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
- Why using Post Order DFS ->
    - ```Order``` of ABC is important. With regular DFS, We reach to ACBC. We shouldn't repeat C again in ordered dictionary.

    - Add node ```at the end``` of dfs function
    - Add the last node in dfs and marked as visited

    - Another advantage of visited at the end, shows there is ```no loop/cycle```. Because the last node doesn't have any child.
