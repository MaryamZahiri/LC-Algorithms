    "    - Explanation: node(index) -> [neighbor1, neighbor2]\n",
    "    - Example: List[List(int)]: [[neighbor1, neighbor2], [neighbor1, neighbor2], ...] \n",
    "    - Accessable: \n",
    "        - ```for neighbor1, neighbor2 in adjacency_list[node]```\n",
    "    - Time Complexity:\n",
    "        - Insertion\n",
    "            - Adding an Edge: (O(1)) on average.\n",
    "            Explanation: On average, appending an edge to an existing list of neighbors for a vertex is a constant-time operation. However, if the list of neighbors needs to be resized or reorganized (e.g., converted to a linked list for better performance), the time complexity could increase.\n",
    "        - Removal\n",
    "            - Removing an Edge: (O(1)) on average.\n",
    "            Explanation: Similarly, removing an edge from a list of neighbors is a constant-time operation on average. The actual time complexity can vary based on the data structure used to store the neighbors (e.g., array vs. linked list).\n",
    "        - Lookup\n",
    "            - Finding All Neighbors: (O(|N|)), where (|N|) is the degree of the vertex (the number of neighbors).\n",
    "            Explanation: To find all neighbors of a vertex, you need to iterate through the list of neighbors. The time complexity is thus proportional to the number of neighbors, which is the degree of the vertex.\n",
    "            Connectivity Query\n",
    "            - Finding All Connected Vertices: (O(V + E)) in the worst case.\n",
    "            Explanation: To find all vertices connected to a given vertex, you might need to traverse the entire graph starting from that vertex, visiting each vertex once and potentially exploring edges multiple times. Thus, the time complexity includes both the number of vertices ((V)) and the number of edges ((E)).\n",
    "    - Pros: \n",
    "        - Space Efficiency only for existing edges (less than Vertices^2) - more space-efficient than adjacency matrices, especially for sparse graphs where the number of edges is much less than (V^2)\n",
    "    - Cons: \n",
    "        - Time Comlexity for lookup all edges to a vertex: O(V) - In contrast, adjacency matrices provide constant-time lookup for any edge. (Not Suitable for Dense Graphs where the number of edges is close to the maximum possible)\n",
    "        - Complexity in Representation: more complex than with adjacency matrices, especially when dealing with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) or multigraphs where there might be multiple edges between two nodes.\n",
    "        - Complex code: Unlike adjacency matrices, accessing an element directly by row and column indices is not possible with adjacency lists.\n",

    "> Notes: Why (V^2) Edges in graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Direct Correlation: Each edge connects exactly two vertices. Therefore, for a graph to be complete, it must have enough edges to ensure that every possible pair of vertices is connected. Since there are (V) ways to choose the first vertex and (V - 1) ways to choose the second vertex (to avoid choosing the same vertex twice), the total number of edges needed is (V \\times (V - 1) / 2). This formula represents the combination formula for choosing 2 items out of (V), which simplifies to approximately (V^2 / 2) for large (V), but in the context of complete graphs, we often consider the upper bound as (V^2), especially when discussing the density of connections in a graph"
