# LeetCode Problem 133: [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/)
## Problem Description
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
## Solution Approaches
### DFS Algorithm
Algorithm Pattern: Graph Cloning using DFS

1. Initialization
    - Purpose: Prepare the necessary data structures for the algorithm.
    - Steps:
        - Create a dictionary ```oldToNew``` to map nodes in the original graph to their corresponding nodes in the cloned graph.
2. DFS Function
    -   Purpose: Perform a depth-first search on the original graph to clone it.
    - Steps:
        - Define a nested function ```dfs``` that takes a node from the original graph as input.
        - Check if the node has already been visited (i.e., if it exists in ```oldToNew```). If so, return the corresponding node from the cloned graph.
        - Create a new node ```copy``` in the cloned graph with the same value as the original node.
        - Add the mapping from the original node to the new node in oldToNew.
        - Iterate over each neighbor of the original node. For each neighbor, recursively call ```dfs``` to clone the neighbor and its subgraph. Append the cloned neighbor to the ```neighbors``` list of the new node.
        - Return the new node.
3. Main Function
    - Purpose: Initiate the cloning process.
    - Steps:
        - Call the ```dfs``` function with the root node of the original graph to start the cloning process.
        - Return the cloned root node.
4. Utility Function (Optional)
    - Purpose: Provide a way to visualize or verify the cloned graph.
    - Steps:
        -Define a utility function to print the graph nodes and their neighbors. This is useful for debugging and verifying the correctness of the cloned graph.
## Example Description

## Python Code
Inputs
```python
# Node or Index -> [neighbor 1, neighbor 2]
adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
```
Node Class
```python
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
```
Solution Class
```python
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        oldToNew = {}

        def dfs(node):
            # visited
            if node in oldToNew:
                return oldToNew[node]

            copy = Node(node.val)
            oldToNew[node] = copy

            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))
            return copy
        
        return dfs(node) if node else None
```
Utility Function
```python
# Graph = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
# Create nodes
node1 = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node3 = Node(3)
node4 = Node(4)

# Define neighbors
node1.neighbors = [node2, node4]
node2.neighbors = [node1, node3]
node3.neighbors = [node2, node4]
node4.neighbors = [node1, node3]

solution = Solution()
cloned_graph = solution.cloneGraph(node1)

# Function to print graph nodes and their neighbors
def print_graph(node, visited):
    if not node or node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    print(f"Node {node.val} -> {[n.val for n in node.neighbors]}")
    for neighbor in node.neighbors:
        print_graph(neighbor, visited)

# Print original and cloned graphs
print("Original Graph:")
print_graph(node1, set())
print("\nCloned Graph:")
print_graph(cloned_graph, set())
```
## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity : O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because each node is visited exactly once.
    > Time complexity of the Clone Graph problem solution using DFS is O(V + E), and the use of O(N) in the provided Python code is a simplification that effectively represents the same complexity.

- Space complexity : O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the graph. This is due to the space required for the ```oldToNew``` dictionary and the recursive call stack in the worst case.
