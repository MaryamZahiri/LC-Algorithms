# LeetCode Problem 417: [Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/description/)
## Problem Description
Given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top edges of the matrix, and the "Atlantic ocean" touches the right and bottom edges.

Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell to another one with height equal or lower.

Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
## Solution Approaches
### DFS Algorithm
Algorithm Pattern: Pacific Atlantic Water Flow using DFS

Solution involves using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths from the border cells to the interior of the grid, marking cells that can flow to both oceans.

1. Initialization
    - Purpose: Prepare the necessary data structures for the algorithm.
    - Steps:
        - Check if the input grid heights is empty. If so, return an empty list.
        - Initialize two sets, pacific_visit and atlantic_visit, to keep track of cells visited by the DFS for the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, respectively.
2. DFS Function
    - Purpose: Perform a depth-first search from each border cell to explore all possible paths to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
    - Steps:
        - Define a nested function dfs that takes a cell (row, col), a set (visit), and the height of the previous cell (pre_height) as input.
        - Check if the new cell is within the grid boundaries. If not, return.
        - Check if the new cell has already been visited. If it has, return.
        - Check if the new cell's height is less than the previous cell's height. If so, return, as water cannot flow from a higher cell to a lower one.
        - Mark the new cell as visited by adding it to the visit set.
        - Perform DFS by recursively calling the dfs function for each of the 4 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) that are within the grid boundaries, have not been visited yet, and have a height equal to or lower than the current cell.
3. Main Function
    - Purpose: Determine which cells can flow to both oceans.
    - Steps:
        - Loop through each cell adjacent to the oceans (left and top edges for Pacific, right and bottom edges for Atlantic) and start a DFS from each of these cells, marking cells that can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
        - After the DFS is complete, find the intersection of pacific_visit and atlantic_visit to get the cells that can reach both oceans.
        - Return the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

            # This cell is reachable, so mark it
            visit.add((row, col))

            # If we've gotten this far, that means the new cell is reachable
            # neighbors: dfs for 4 neighbor direction

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity : O(M * N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid. This is because each cell in the grid is visited at most once.

- Space complexity : O(M * N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid. This is due to the space required for the pacific and atlantic matrices and the call stack in the worst case.
