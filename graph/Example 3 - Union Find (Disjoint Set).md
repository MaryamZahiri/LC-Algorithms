# Graph Algorithm - Union Find (Disjoint Set)
The primary use of disjoint sets is to address the ```connectivity``` between the components of a network. 
For instance, we can use a disjoint set to determine if two people share a common ancestor.

- Parent node: the direct parent node of a vertex. For example, in Figure , the parent node of vertex 3 is 1, the parent node of vertex 2 is 0, and the parent node of vertex 9 is 9.
- Root node: a node without a parent node; it can be viewed as the parent node of itself. For example, in Figure, the root node of vertices 3 and 2 is 0.
