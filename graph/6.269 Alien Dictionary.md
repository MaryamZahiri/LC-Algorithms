# LeetCode Problem 269: [Questions](https://leetcode.com/problems/)
## Problem Description
## Solution Approaches
### BFS Algorithm
Algorithm Pattern:
- A topological Sort
- DFS Recursive
- Post order DFS: if there is no child for vertix, add it to visited and backtrack to previous node by popping the visited node at the end
- Reverse the order

1. Initialization:
    - Create Adjacency list/Graph
        - if length of word 1 is larger than length of word 2, but they have the first min(length) letters are the same, there is invalid solution -> ""
        - differ at the first letter, add to adjecency list and break
    - Track Visited
    - Track Path
2. DFS Function
## Example Description

## Python Code
```python
```
## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity : 

- Space complexity :

## Questions
- What is Topological Sort -> 
    - Should be DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) -> Directed graph but no cycle
    - A linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
