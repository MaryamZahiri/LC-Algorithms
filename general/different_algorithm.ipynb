    "Question: Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten. It means simultanious check by level by level to add to minutes after 1 level before next level\n",
    "Goal: \n",
    "    - Track the time it takes for all fresh oranges to rot, considering level-by-level progression.\n",
    "    - because all adjacent oranges rot simultaneously\n",
    "Pattern: is naturally a BFS problem as it requires simultaneous rotting, which BFS handles efficiently.\n",
    "Why not visited track: \n",
    "    - eparate visited set would be redundant since the grid's state already prevents reprocessing of rotted cells.\n",
    "Why not traverse grid after BFS:\n",
    "    - After the BFS finishes, thereâ€™s no need to traverse the grid again unless you're checking if any fresh oranges (1s) remain.\n",
